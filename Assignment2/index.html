    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<section class="story">
  <p>
    This page explores Melbourne’s metropolitan landscape by examining the relationship between 
    <strong>train passenger activity</strong> and the <strong>distribution of top-rated restaurants</strong> (TripAdvisor, 2024–25). 
    Using open transport data and spatial visualisations, it reveals how patterns of rail usage and station proximity correspond with areas of high dining concentration across the city.
  </p>

  <p>
    By combining transport and hospitality data, this page aims to highlight the interdependence between public transport accessibility and urban vibrancy. 
    Stations with strong connectivity often anchor mixed-use activity, not just as nodes for travel but also as magnets for dining, leisure, and local commerce. 
    In doing so, these insights underscore the role of shaping where people move, meet, and eat across Melbourne.
  </p>
</section>


    <!-- 1) Train map-->
    <h2>Melbourne Metro Trains Network + Passenger Numbers (FY2024/25)</h2>
    <div id="symbol_map" class="vis"></div>
    <section class="story">
      <p>
        The map illustrates the Metro Trains network across metropolitan Melbourne, visualised through colour intensity to represent annual passenger volumes on a log scale. Stations along the City Loop stand out as the busiest, driven by heavy commuter inflows each morning and outflows each evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suburban hubs such as Box Hill, Caulfield, and Glen Waverley also show strong activity, acting as interchange points between rail, tram, and bus networks. These nodes highlight the decentralised structure of Melbourne's rail system, where activity remains concentrated at key suburban centres.
      </p>

      <p>
        Passenger intensity generally declines with increasing distance from the CBD, reflecting how accessibility, employment density, and population distribution shape transit demand across the city's rail corridors.
      </p>
    </section>


    <!-- 2) Top 10 -->
    <h2>The Top 10 Stations</h2>
    <div id="top10_bars" class="vis"></div>
    <div id="errBars" class="err"></div>
<section class="story">
  <p>
    This bar chart compares <strong>AM peak</strong>, <strong>PM peak</strong>, and <strong>Total</strong> passenger volumes for the ten busiest stations across metropolitan Melbourne. 
    The Total view highlights the dominance of <em>Flinders Street</em>, <em>Southern Cross</em>, and <em>Melbourne Central</em> , all of which is located within the City Loop.
    These central hubs funnel most train activity through the network. Together, these three stations account for the majority of total boardings and alightings, reflecting 
    their critical role as interchange and destination points for both commuters and visitors.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the AM peak, suburban stations such as <em>Box Hill</em>, <em>Caulfield</em>, and <em>Footscray</em> show comparatively stronger activity, 
    representing inbound commuter flows toward the CBD. In contrast, inner-city stations like <em>Flagstaff</em> and <em>Parliament</em> record smaller morning volumes 
    since they primarily serve office workers arriving rather than departing at that time. This pattern reflects Melbourne’s radial commuting structure, where residential suburbs 
    feed into central employment zones during morning hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    The PM peak view reverses this trend, showing a sharp rise in activity at <em>Flinders Street</em>, <em>Southern Cross</em>, and <em>Melbourne Central</em>. 
    These stations dominate evening travel as thousands of workers, shoppers, and diners return home or move between city precincts. 
    Notably, <em>Flagstaff</em> and <em>Melbourne Central</em> demonstrate stronger PM peaks relative to their AM figures. This is a sign of sustained after-work 
    movement toward leisure, shopping, and dining destinations. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, key suburban hubs such as <em>South Yarra</em>, <em>Richmond</em>, and <em>Footscray</em> shows a balanced AM–PM patterns, reflecting their 
    dual role as both employment and residential catchments. 
    Overall, the combination of all three metrics reveals a clear temporal rhythm across the network. A strong AM inflow from the suburbs and a
    concentrated PM outflows through central hubs, and consistent total throughput reinforcing the City Loop’s key role in Melbourne's rail system.
  </p>

    <!-- 3) Accessibility gradient -->
    <h2>Accessibility to the City (Distance)</h2>
    <div id="access" class="vis"></div>
    <div id="err3" class="err"></div>
<section class="story">
  <p>
    Plotting annual passengers against distance from Flinders Street reveals a clear decline. Station usage generally declines the further one travels from the city centre. The steep initial drop within the first 5 km reflects Melbourne’s concentration of employment, education, and entertainment within the CBD, where short trips are often made on foot or by tram instead of train. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond this inner zone, passenger volumes stabilise at moderate levels between approximately 6 – 12 km, representing mid-ring suburbs where commuters rely more heavily other modes of transport such as local buses or trams. A noticeable rebound occurs around <strong>14 – 18 km</strong>, where they coincide with dense activity centres such as Box Hill, Clayton, and St Albans. These areas act as secondary employment and retail hubs, generating both inbound and outbound travel throughout the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>LOESS trend line</strong> (in red) visually emphasises this pattern: a sharp decline near the city, a trough in middle distances, and a gradual upturn in high-density suburban nodes before tapering off again in outer areas. Stations beyond 25 km show a steady decline in usage, reflecting lower population density, longer travel times, and greater reliance on park-and-ride or feeder buses.
  </p>
</section>


    <!-- 4) Restaurants map -->
    <h2>What about the Top 500 Restaurants?</h2>
<section class="section-row side-by-side">
  <div id="restaurant_map" class="vis vis--controls-tight"></div>
 <div class="story story--side">
  <p>
    Restaurant locations cluster strongly in the CBD, with additional concentrations in inner suburbs such as Southbank, Carlton, and Fitzroy. This spatial pattern highlights how Melbourne’s hospitality scene aligns with areas of high pedestrian activity, cultural attractions, and commercial density.
  </p>

  <p>
    Filtering by price category shows distinct spatial segregation. Affordable and mid-range restaurants (<strong>$</strong> and <strong>$$–$$$</strong>) are distributed broadly along the train corridors and local activity centres, providing accessibility to a wide population. In contrast, premium venues (<strong>$$$$</strong>) are heavily concentrated within the central grid and inner-east suburbs, reflecting higher median incomes, strong tourism flows, and proximity to business districts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The clustering pattern also corresponds with transport accessibility: almost all top-rated restaurants fall within short walking distance of railway stations or tram lines. This indicates that mobility infrastructure not only shapes commuting patterns but also influences where high-value leisure and dining activities occur across metropolitan Melbourne.

      <!-- 5) CBD linked map -->
    <h2>Let's see how they are linked</h2>
<section class="section-row side-by-side">
  <div id="cbd" class="vis vis--wide"></div>

  <div class="story story--side">

     <p><strong>Station-Restaurant Relationships:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flinders Street</strong> serves as the central hub, with restaurants radiating throughout the entire CBD grid</li>
          <li><strong>Melbourne Central</strong> anchors the northern CBD and provides access to Carlton's Lygon Street dining precinct</li>
          <li><strong>Southern Cross</strong> connects the western CBD and Docklands area with its waterfront restaurants</li>
          <li><strong>Parliament</strong> serves the eastern CBD and provides the closest access to Fitzroy's Brunswick Street</li>
          <li><strong>Flagstaff</strong>, while having fewer immediate restaurants, serves the legal and business district</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Despite inner-northern suburbs like Carlton and Fitzroy having no local heavy-rail stations, they remain well-connected to top dining options via Melbourne Central and Parliament stations, demonstrating the loop's extended reach beyond the immediate CBD boundaries.</p>

        <p>The clustering pattern shows that no single station dominates restaurant distribution, highlighting the loop's success in providing equitable access to Melbourne's culinary offerings across different city precincts.</p>

  </div>
</section>

    <!-- 6) Scatter -->
    <h2>Let's consider the suburbs too</h2>
    <div id="scatter" class="vis"></div>
    <div id="errscatter" class="err"></div>
   <section class="story">
  <p>
    This scatterplot explores the relationship between annual passenger volumes
    and the number of nearby Top 500 restaurants for each train station across metropolitan Melbourne.
  </p>

  <p>
    When viewing all stations, the pattern is heavily influenced by the 
    City Loop — particularly <em>Flinders Street</em>, <em>Southern Cross</em>, and 
    <em>Melbourne Central</em> — which attract exceptionally high passenger numbers and large restaurant clusters. 
    These central hubs dominate the scale and create an apparent strong positive relationship between restaurant density 
    and rail usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, when City Loop stations are excluded, the relationship becomes much weaker. 
    Suburban stations such as <em>South Yarra</em>, <em>Box Hill</em>, and <em>Richmond</em> show moderate restaurant 
    concentrations despite varying passenger volumes, suggesting that local factors — like commercial zoning, nearby activity 
    centres, and demographics — play a more significant role than passenger traffic alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the comparison highlights how the City Loop amplifies the visibility of Melbourne’s core 
    dining and transport activity, while suburban areas demonstrate more diverse, locally driven patterns
    of restaurant clustering.
  </p>
</section>


    <!-- 7) Histogram -->
    <h2>Hmm... what about walking distance?</h2>
    <div id="hist" class="vis"></div>
    <div id="errhist" class="err"></div>
<section class="story">
  <p>
    The histogram highlights walking accessibility between restaurants and train stations across metropolitan Melbourne. 
    A large proportion of restaurants are located within <strong>400–500 metres</strong> of a train station, indicating that most venues are easily reachable on foot. 
    This suggests that Melbourne’s most popular dining areas tend to cluster within established public transport hubs, 
    where foot traffic and visibility support higher customer turnover.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cumulative line in red reinforces this trend, showing that approximately <strong>two-thirds (≈67%)</strong> of restaurants lie within <strong>500 metres</strong> 
    of a station, while more than 80% are within 1 kilometre. Beyond that distance, accessibility drops sharply where there are relatively few restaurants 
    are more than 1.5 km away, underscoring the importance of proximity to rail corridors in shaping Melbourne’s dining geography.
  </p>

  <p>
    This pattern illustrates how the developemt of key public transport areas influences urban food distribution. Restaurants naturally concentrate where public transport, 
    walking infrastructure, and customer demand intersect. The strong accessibility gradient implies that rail-connected precincts such as <em>South Yarra</em>, 
    <em>Richmond</em>, and <em>Flinders Street</em> are not only transport nodes but also are social and economic anchors for surrounding nightlife 
    and retail activity.
  </p>
</section>


    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<section class="story">
  <p>
    From the metro network to individual venues, the visuals together reveal a strong and consistent relationship between mobility and hospitality
    in metropolitan Melbourne. The City Loop anchors daily movement and economic activity within the CBD, 
    while suburban hubs such as <em>Box Hill</em>, <em>Caulfield</em>, and <em>Footscray</em> extend this network’s reach into diverse residential and commercial areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    The analysis shows that rail accessibility strongly correlates with restaurant density. 
    Most top-rated venues are within easy walking distance of a station, typically under 500 metres. This reinforced how proximity to public transport underpins 
    Melbourne’s vibrant food culture. This accessibility supports not only local residents but also tourists and commuters seeking convenient, connected places to dine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, the findings demonstrate that great food and great transport go hand-in-hand. 
    Melbourne’s restaurants thrive where trains, trams, and footpaths converge, highlighting how effective transit planning contributes not just to mobility 
    but also to economic vitality, social engagement, and cultural experience. 
    In essence, <em>Melbourne’s best meals are never far from the next train stop</em>.
